<h2>Ariel Kennan</h2>
       <h4>Ariel Kennan is a Director of Design at Sidewalk Labs, where draws upon her experience in multidisciplinary design and technology to collaborate with community, government, and industry partners to design service experiences, craft strategy, and create and source digital tools.

<br><br>Before Sidewalk, Ariel served the New York City Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity as Director of Design and Product. In that role, she led the design and development of a portfolio of digital products and founded the nation’s first municipal service design studio dedicated to making public services for low-income residents as effective and accessible as possible. Her time in government was inspired through fellowships with Code for America and the Center for Urban Pedagogy, where she discovered the potential for design in the public sector. Ariel previously designed and produced experiences for the built environment, ranging from intimate immersive media to expansive buildings. She holds a BFA in Integrated Design from Parsons School of Design.
<br><br>
Originally from Arizona, she lives in Brooklyn with her husband. She loves riding bikes and cooking delicious meals.</h4>
