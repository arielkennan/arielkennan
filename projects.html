 We work with people who design, deliver, administer, use, and influence public benefits. We work across key benefits programs including food and nutrition (SNAP, WIC), health (Medicaid/CHIP), cash assistance (TANF, basic income), child care, and unemployment insurance (UI) to identify shared challenges and opportunities, and to amplify strategies to enable equitable and effective implementation. We explore current and near-term challenges, while also creating space to envision and explore future policies, services, and technologies.</p>
